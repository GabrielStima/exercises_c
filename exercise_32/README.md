# Exercise 32

### Activity Description

- Finding the largest, smallest, average, and arranging numbers or sequences are the most important algorithms studied in Computing. In C it could be no different. In our course, obviously, it won't be any different either. Write a C program that prompts the user for 10 numbers through a while loop and at the end shows which of these numbers is the largest.
