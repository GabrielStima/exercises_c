# Exercise 19

### Activity Description
- Develop a program where the user can inform the salary received in the month and the total amount spent in the month. After the values are entered, the program must show the following messages on the screen: "Expenses within the budget" if the amount spent has not exceeded the monthly salary and "Budget overrun" if the amount spent exceeded the monthly salary. If the expenses are within the budget, the program should inform the amount that the user can save, and if the expenses have exceeded the budget, the program should inform how much the user will owe for the month.
