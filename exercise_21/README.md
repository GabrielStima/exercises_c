# Exercise 21

### Activity Description
- Develop a program that assists in the construction of a water reservoir. This program can be used by consumers to control the flow and consumption of water. The program should ask for the dimensions of a reservoir (height, width and length, in centimeters) and the average daily consumption of the consumers of the water reservoir (in liters/day).

- Assume that the water reservoir is full, that it has a cubic form, and insert:
    - The total capacity of the reservoir, in liters;
    - The tank's autonomy, in days;
    - The consumption classification, according to the number of days of autonomy: High consumption, if the autonomy is less than 2 days; moderate consumption, if the autonomy is between 2 and 7 days; low consumption, if the autonomy is longer than 7 days.

**Note: Consider that each liter is equivalent to 1000 cm3 or 1 dm3.
